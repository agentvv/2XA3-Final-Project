# 2XA3-Final-Project
Final project for my assembly class

I only created the sorthem.asm and makefile files, everything else was given.

The goal of this project was to sort "disks" on a "peg", essentially just sorting an array of integers. We first needed to get a random disk configuration from the given rconf function, then use recursion to sort it, printing it as we went. The showp subprogram prints the current configuration, and sorthem sorts the disks. The sorthem file is the executable.
